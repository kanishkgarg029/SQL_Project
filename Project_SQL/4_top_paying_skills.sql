Breakdown of the results:
- Big Data and AI Tools: High salaries are linked to skills in big data processing (e.g., PySpark, Databricks) and AI/ML platforms (e.g., DataRobot, Watson), reflecting demand for expertise in handling and automating large-scale data insights.
- Cloud Infrastructure and Deployment: Knowledge of cloud services (e.g., GCP) and deployment tools (e.g., Kubernetes, Airflow) is highly valued, as data roles increasingly involve scalable, production-ready environments.
- Advanced Programming and Collaboration: Specialized languages (e.g., Swift, Scala) and collaborative tools (e.g., Bitbucket, GitLab) highlight the importance of versatile programming and team-oriented skills in top-paying roles.
